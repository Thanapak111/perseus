## Introduction

Managing dependencies in Go can often feel overwhelming. As projects grow, so do the complexities of module graphs. **Perseus** offers a straightforward solution to visualize and manage these dependencies. By using **Perseus**, developers can focus more on writing code and less on managing conflicts and issues.

## Features

- **Visual Dependency Graphs**: Generate clear and interactive graphs of your Go module dependencies.
- **Conflict Resolution**: Identify and resolve conflicts in dependencies easily.
- **Version Management**: Keep track of different versions of your modules.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple and intuitive interface for seamless navigation.
